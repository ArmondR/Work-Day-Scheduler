# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This application is a work day scheduler. When application is accessed, the user is presented with the current day within the header. Below are a set of rows labeled from 9am to 5pm that take user input and allow the user to save the input into local storage for later use. For added user experience the application color codes rows depended on the time of day.

##  Usage 

The application was published through github and can be accessed via the provided link below. This application will be receiving UI updates in the future to better accomodate the user. Features that will be added are: automated task time auditing as well as an alert to allow the user to know their tasks have been saved when clicking the save button.

## Other
Instead of using moment.js for the time control of the application I explored an alternative method and decided to incorporate JavaScript Internationalization API as an alternative.
